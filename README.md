## Web Application

### Notes
Although this doesn't directly do anything on it's own (such as with a calculator or database listing),
it is intended to be used as a UI for something such as a list or other application needing an intuitive way to organize data for the user.
The code used under the hood is quite complex, so this should be an interesting experiment with this sort of functionality.
- Doesn't use external libraries intentionally - Base functionality was fun to learn
- Fully contained client-side application
- Drag-and-drop interface experiment

### Instructions
Simply open the file `index.html` in a web browser, and play around with the draggable elements.
More detailed instructions are included on the webpage.

## Final Project

### Notes
#### Name: Online restaurant menu
This project is a prototype of an online order-taking site.
One major function of it (to display the functionality of mongodb and http requests) is that if you leave the page,
when you return, your cart will still have the same items in it.
This is to show how this website will work when both the restaurant and customers are using it,
so that the restaurant can actually see each person's order.
- Doesn't use external libraries except for nodejs and mongodb intentionally - Once more, base functionality was fun to learn
- Fully contained server/client application
- Drag-and-drop interface, order persistence

### Instructions
Open the file `final/server.js` in the terminal and type `node .` to start the server.
Then, in your web browser, enter the address `localhost:9000`.
